Playing Skyrim I had to move from one house to another. I asked a companion to take my stuff. He took them, but they got marked "stolen". I found a way to fix it, but to do that I had to move things from my chest to inventory and back again. I have a lot of items, click tired, so i was looking for autoclicker.

I doesnt found good autoclicker, so made this. By pressing button "z" (English layout only) it:
1. Click LMB
2. Wait 10 microseconds
3. Presses Enter
4. Waits 10 microseconds
5. Goes to the first item until you stop it by pressing the button again

Perfect for dragging a bunch of stuff from/into a chest. Maybe I'll add more to it, add some settings, or not, idk.

Instructions:
1. Download release
2. Launch .exe, just a black window appears.
3. At the right moment click on "z".
4. Profit

Or (from the source code)

1. Clone
2. Install GCC and Go
3. Compile, run
